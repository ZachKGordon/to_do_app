Hello!


This is my To Do App for the Code Fellows code challenge. Using jQuery I created add item, update item, and delete item functionality. Additionally, I created a functionality that will display list items as a link to an external site if an item is a key word. For example groceries will trigger a link to QFC.There are two key words. In addition, the app has an Express server and is displayed to Heroku With a url of https://zg-to-do-app.herokuapp.com/ The app also includes the skeleton grid, basic html, and css styling. Thank you.
